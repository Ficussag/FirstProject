	Snake Game in C++

Welcome to the repository for the Snake Game, a classic arcade game reimagined in C++.
This project is a fun and engaging way to explore the fundamentals of 
game development, object-oriented programming, and the C++ language itself.

	Overview
The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. 
The objective is to navigate the snake through a grid, collecting food while avoiding collisions with 
the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game area. 
The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game area's boundaries.

	Features
Classic Gameplay: Experience the thrill of navigating the snake through a grid, collecting food, and growing longer as you progress.
Object-Oriented Design: The game is designed with object-oriented principles in mind, making it a great example for 
learning how to structure a game in C++.
Customizable Game Area: The game area's dimensions are easily adjustable, allowing for different gameplay experiences.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you navigate the snake through the game area.
Simple Controls: Use the keyboard to control the snake's direction.
Getting Started
