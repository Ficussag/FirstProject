	Snake Game in C++

Welcome to the repository for the Snake Game, a classic arcade game reimagined in C++.
This project is a fun and engaging way to explore the fundamentals of game development, object-oriented programming, and the C++ language itself.

	Overview
The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. 
The objective is to navigate the snake through a grid, collecting food while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game area. 
The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game area's boundaries.
